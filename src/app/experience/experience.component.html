        <h6><b>Software Developer Consultant</b></h6>
        <h6>Genpact India Private Limited</h6>
        <p>• As a Frontend Developer, I leveraged my expertise in Angular, TypeScript to create an advanced GENAI Playground, designed exclusively for internal use at Genpact. This platform, like Azure's OpenAI Playground, allows users to explore various AI functionalities, integrating cutting-edge OpenAI features such as ChatGPT for conversational AI, file translation, video indexing, and image generation across multiple models.</p>
        <p>• Additionally, I contributed to the development of a desktop application Digital Assistant, which operates as a docked widget on the right bottom corner of all 1 lakh+ Genpact devices, with an active user base ranging from 10,000 - 20,000 users.</p>
        <p>• Also worked on MeetingAssist, a tool designed to generate meeting notes for SFDC accounts, and on the SOC Report system, which streamlines the audit reporting process for multiple vendors over a financial year.</p>
        <p>• Utilizing RESTful APIs, I ensured efficient data flow and interaction between these components, optimizing performance through asynchronous programming and state management with RxJS.</p>
